# Divergence in Drought Trends for Europe

This repository contains code associated with "Observed drought indices show increasing divergence across Europe" by Stagge et al.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this code, you must install:
* [R for Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/)

All necesary R packages will be installed automatically in the first file.

## Running the Code

### Running all scripts at once

Code is numbered in order of operations.  If you would like to simply recreate results from the paper, you may run the following from any command line after installing R. For more detailed information about each file, see below:

```
Rscript 00_prepare_file_system.R
Rscript 01_continental_diverge.R
Rscript 02_spatial_diverge.R
Rscript 03_climate_trends.R
Rscript 04_et_trends_model_comparison.R
```
